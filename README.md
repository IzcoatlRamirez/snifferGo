## Autonomous sniffer

In this problem, the scenario of a vacuum agent operating in a specific environment is presented. The key features of the problem include:

Environment: The environment is a discretized space (for example, a grid) where the vacuum cleaner moves. Each cell in the grid can be clean or dirty.

Vacuum Agent: The agent is the vacuum cleaner that takes actions to clean the environment. The agent has sensors to perceive the state of the environment and actuators to perform actions.

Perceptions and Actions: The agent perceives its environment through sensors. In this case, sensors can detect whether a cell is clean or dirty. The agent's actions include moving to an adjacent cell and cleaning the cell it is in.

Goal: The main goal of the agent is to clean the entire environment, maximizing the number of clean cells and minimizing the actions performed.
